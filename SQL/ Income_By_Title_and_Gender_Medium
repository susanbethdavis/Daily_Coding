Problem: Find the average total compensation based on employee titles and gender. Total compensation is calculated by adding both 
the salary and bonus of each employee. However, not every employee receives a bonus so disregard employees without bonuses in your 
calculation. Employee can receive more than one bonus. Output the employee title, gender (i.e., sex), along with the average total 
compensation.

Tables: sf_employee, sf_bonus

My code: 

SELECT employee_title, sex, avg(salary + bonus) as avg_complensation FROM 
sf_employee
JOIN (select worker_ref_id, sum(bonus) as bonus
FROM sf_bonus
GROUP BY worker_ref_id) as bonus_table
ON sf_employee.id = bonus_table.worker_ref_id
GROUP BY employee_title, sex;
