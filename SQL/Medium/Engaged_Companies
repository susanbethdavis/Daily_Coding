Problem: 
(company_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table, which ensures unique entries for combinations of company_id and activity_type. Each row records how often a specific activity occurred for a company.

The average performance for a particular activity_type is the average count across all companies that engage in this activity.

An engaged company is defined as a company that has two or more activity_type entries for which their count is strictly higher than the corresponding average performance.

Write a query to identify all engaged companies.

Return the result in any order.


My Code: 
/* 
Break into sub-problems:
  1. Calculate the average: Start by finding the average performance for
  each activity_type
  
  2. Identify qualifying activities: Compare each company's count against
  these averages and identify the entries that exceed the ActivityAverages
  
  3. Count the qualifying enteries per company 
  
  4. Filter for engaged companies: Retain companies with two. or more qualifying entires
