Problem: 
Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, 
write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. 
The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

My Code: 
with spent_table as (
SELECT category, product, 
sum(spend) as total_spend,
rank() over(partition by category order by sum(spend) desc) as ranking
FROM product_spend
where transaction_date >= '01/01/2022 00:00:00'
group by category, product
)

select category, product, total_spend
from spent_table
where ranking <=2;
