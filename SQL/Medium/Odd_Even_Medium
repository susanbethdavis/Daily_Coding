Problem: 
This is the same question as problem #28 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.


My Code: 

WITH ranked_measurements AS (
    SELECT 
        measurement_id,
        measurement_time,
        measurement_value,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY DATE(measurement_time)
            ORDER BY measurement_time ASC
        ) AS ranked_value
    FROM measurements
)
SELECT 
    DATE(measurement_time) AS date, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN ranked_value IN (1, 3, 5) THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ranked_value IN (2, 4, 6) THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
FROM ranked_measurements
GROUP BY DATE(measurement_time)
ORDER BY DATE(measurement_time);
