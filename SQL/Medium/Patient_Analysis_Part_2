Problem: 
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are classified into various categories, but some calls cannot be neatly categorised. These uncategorised calls are labeled as “n/a”, or are left empty when the support agent does not enter anything into the call category field.

Write a query to calculate the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place. For example, 45.0, 48.5, 57.7.
Definition:

Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.


My Code: 

SELECT
  ROUND(
    100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN call_category = 'n/a' OR call_category IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),
    1
  ) AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM callers;
