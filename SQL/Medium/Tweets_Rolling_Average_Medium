Problem: 
This is the same question as problem #10 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.
Effective April 7th, 2023, the problem statement, solution and hints for this question have been revised.


My Code: 
SELECT 
  user_id,
  tweet_date,
  round(AVG(tweet_count) OVER(
    PARTITION BY user_id
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),2) AS rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets;
