Problem: 
This is the same question as problem #11 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user.
Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

My Code: 
with ordered_trans as(
  SELECT user_id, spend, transaction_date,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date ASC) AS emp_rank
  from transactions
)

select user_id, spend, transaction_date 
from ordered_trans
where emp_rank = 3
;
