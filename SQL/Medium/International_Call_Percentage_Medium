Problem: 
A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

Assumption:

The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.
My Code: 
/* A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country
then the person reciecing the call */ 
WITH caller_reciever_match as
  (SELECT  
    caller.country_id AS caller_country,
    receiver.country_id AS receiver_country
  FROM phone_calls AS calls
  LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
    ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
  LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
    ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id)
  
Select ROUND(100 * count(case when caller_country <> receiver_country then 1 END) * 1.0/ Count(*), 1) as international_calls_pct
from caller_reciever_match;
