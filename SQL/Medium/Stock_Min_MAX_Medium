Problem: 
The Bloomberg terminal is the go-to resource for financial professionals, offering convenient access to a wide array of financial datasets. As a Data Analyst at Bloomberg, you have access to historical data on stock performance.

Currently, you're analyzing the highest and lowest open prices for each FAANG stock by month over the years.

For each FAANG stock, display the ticker symbol, the month and year ('Mon-YYYY') with the corresponding highest and lowest open prices (refer to the Example Output format). Ensure that the results are sorted by ticker symbol.
My Code: 

WITH temp_table AS (
    SELECT 
        ticker,
        MIN(open) AS open_min,
        MAX(open) AS open_max
    FROM stock_prices
    GROUP BY ticker
)

SELECT 
    tt.ticker, 
    to_char(high.date,'Mon-YYYY') AS high_month,
    tt.open_max,
    to_char(low.date,'Mon-YYYY') AS low_month,
    tt.open_min
FROM temp_table AS tt
INNER JOIN stock_prices AS high ON tt.ticker = high.ticker AND tt.open_max = high.open
INNER JOIN stock_prices AS low ON tt.ticker = low.ticker AND tt.open_min = low.open
ORDER BY ticker;
