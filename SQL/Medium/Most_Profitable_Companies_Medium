Find the 3 most profitable companies in the world. Sort the result based on profits in descending order. If multiple companies have the same profit, assign them the same rank and include all tied companies in the top results. Output the result along with the corresponding company name.

Table: forbes_global_2010_2014

My Code: 
SELECT 
    company, profits 
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        company, 
        profits, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY profits DESC) AS rank
     FROM 
        forbes_global_2010_2014
     WHERE 
        profits IS NOT NULL
    ) ranked
WHERE 
    rank <= 3;
