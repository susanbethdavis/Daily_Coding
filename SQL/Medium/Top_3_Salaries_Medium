Problem: 
As part of an ongoing analysis of salary distribution within the company, your manager has requested a report identifying high earners in each department. A 'high earner' within a department is defined as an employee with a salary ranking among the top three salaries within that department.

You're tasked with identifying these high earners across all departments. Write a query to display the employee's name along with their department name and salary. In case of duplicates, sort the results of department name in ascending order, then by salary in descending order. If multiple employees have the same salary, then order them alphabetically.

Note: Ensure to utilize the appropriate ranking window function to handle duplicate salaries effectively.

My Code: 
with department_rank as (
Select employee_id, name, salary, department_id,
DENSE_RANK() over(PARTITION BY department_id order by salary desc) as dep_rank
from employee
)

SELECT department_name, name, salary
from department_rank
inner join department on department_rank.department_id = department.department_id
where dep_rank <= 3
order by department_name asc, salary DESC, name asc;
