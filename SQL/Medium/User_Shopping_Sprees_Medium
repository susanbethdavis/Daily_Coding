Problem: 
In an effort to identify high-value customers, Amazon asked for your help to obtain data about users who go on shopping sprees. A shopping spree occurs when a user makes purchases on 3 or more consecutive days.

List the user IDs who have gone on at least 1 shopping spree in ascending order.

My Code: 
SELECT 
    day_1.user_id
FROM transactions AS day_1
INNER JOIN transactions AS day_2
    ON date(day_2.transaction_date) = date(day_1.transaction_date) + 1
INNER JOIN transactions AS day_3
    ON date(day_3.transaction_date) = date(day_1.transaction_date) + 2
WHERE day_1.user_id = day_2.user_id 
  AND day_1.user_id = day_3.user_id
order by day_1.user_id asc;
