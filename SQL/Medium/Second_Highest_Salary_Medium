Problem: Imagine you're an HR analyst at a tech company tasked with analyzing employee salaries. 
Your manager is keen on understanding the pay distribution and asks you to determine the second highest salary among all employees.
It's possible that multiple employees may share the same second highest salary. In case of duplicate, display the salary only once.


My Code: 

with place_hold as (
SELECT name, salary,
DENSE_RANK() over(order by salary desc)  as second_highest_salary
FROM employee
)

select salary
from place_hold
where second_highest_salary = 2;
