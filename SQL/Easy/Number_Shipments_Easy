Problem: 
Write a query that will calculate the number of shipments per month. The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id 
and sub_id. Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.

My Code: 
SELECT to_char(shipment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
       count(distinct (shipment_id, sub_id)) AS count
FROM amazon_shipment
GROUP BY 1;
