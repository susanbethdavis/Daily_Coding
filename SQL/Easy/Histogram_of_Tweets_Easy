Problem:
This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

My Code: 
SELECT 
tweet_count_per_user AS tweet_bucket,
COUNT(user_id) as users_num
FROM(
  SELECT
  user_id,
  count(tweet_id) as tweet_count_per_user
  from tweets
  WHERE DATE_PART('year',tweet_date) = 2022 
  GROUP BY user_id) as total_tweets
GROUP BY tweet_count_per_user;
