Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use 
(i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

My Code: 
select bike_number, max(end_time) as last_used
from dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
group by bike_number
order by last_used Desc  ;
