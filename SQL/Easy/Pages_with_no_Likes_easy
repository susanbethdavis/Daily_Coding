Problem:
Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

My Code: 

/* The except operator allows us the select only rows in the pages TABLE
whose page id is not in page likes table. If an id is in both tables that 
means that page has at least one like*/ 

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes;

/* Another method */
SELECT pages.page_id
from pages
LEFT JOIN page_likes as likes 
  ON pages.page_id = likes.page_id
where likes.page_id is null;
