Problem:
Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

My Code: 

SELECT 
    candidate_id, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL') THEN 1 END) AS skill_count
FROM candidates
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL') THEN 1 END) = 3
order by candidate_id;


/* Alternative Solution which I like more then my solution */ 

select 
  candidate_id,
  count(skill) as skill_count
from candidates
where skill in ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgresSql')
Group By candidate_id
Having count(skill)  = 3
order by candidate_id;
