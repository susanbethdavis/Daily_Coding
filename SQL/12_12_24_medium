Problem: 
The election is conducted in a city and everyone can vote for one or more candidates, or choose not to vote at all. 
Each person has 1 vote so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates. 
For example, if a person votes for 2 candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of 0.5 vote each.
Find out who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the candidate or multiple names in case of a tie. 
To avoid issues with a floating-point error you can round the number of votes received by a candidate to 3 decimal places.

My Code: 
/* 
vote for 1 person = 1 vote value
vote for 2 people = 1/2 vote value
vote for 3 people = 1/3 vote value 

Step one: create a sub-query to group by voter and and add a new
column that calculates value of each vote for each candidate. Partition
is a good function to do this becuase unlike group by, it does not push
each group into one row. 

Step two: group on canidiate and accumulate their total votes, return
highest vote count and canidate name*/ 

SELECT candidate
FROM (
    SELECT candidate, SUM(value_vote) AS total_value_vote
    FROM (
        SELECT voter, candidate, 
               1.0 / COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY voter) AS value_vote
        FROM voting_results 
        WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
    ) subquery
    GROUP BY candidate
    ORDER BY total_value_vote DESC
) ranked_candidates
LIMIT 1;
