Problem:
Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart. For such posts output all columns from facebook_posts table.

My Code: 

SELECT DISTINCT
    p.post_id, 
    p.poster, 
    p.post_text, 
    p.post_keywords, 
    p.post_date
FROM facebook_reactions r
INNER JOIN facebook_posts p ON r.post_id = p.post_id
WHERE r.reaction = 'heart';
