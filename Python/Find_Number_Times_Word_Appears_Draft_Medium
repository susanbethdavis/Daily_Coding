Proble: Find the number of times each word appears in drafts.
Output the word along with the corresponding number of occurrences.

DataFrame: google_file_store

My Code: 
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
google_file_store.head()

# I could try and loop through each word within each row of the contents columns. Every unique word will be added to a dictionary and given a value of 1. If this word re-appears its key value will be updated to +1

#dictionary to store key value pairs
dictionary = {}
#iterate through each row in the contents columns
def word_count(table):

    for row in table.contents:
        #split each row up into a list of words
        words = row.split()
        for word in words:
            if word not in dictionary: 
                dictionary[word] = 1
            else:
                dictionary[word] += 1
    # Convert the dictionary to a DataFrame
    word_count_df = pd.DataFrame(list(dictionary.items()), columns=["Word", "Count"])
    
    return word_count_df



# select only the rows that are a draft file
draft = google_file_store[google_file_store['filename'].str.contains('draft')]

# call back to previous function to get results 
word_count(draft)
